# How to bind a web report to an array list


<p>This example demonstrates how to bind a web report to a custom object data source and display it on a web page. The data source is represented by the System.Colections.ArrayList object filled with data at runtime. The ArrayList implementation makes a project easier to understand, since there is no need to create a custom object with the IList, ITypedList or IBindingList interfaces.</p>
